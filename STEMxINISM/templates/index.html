     <p style="margin-left: 25%">
         We are women of science and technology . We are volunteers, with a mission. 
     A computer scientist, a biologist and a few other women who want to change the 
     status quo of women who are not treated the same as men in STEM, and hence lose
     out on opportunities . Join us in helping, inspiring, supporting and motivating
     women and help break the glass ceilings of inherent patriarchy

 <div class="rectangle1">
     <h2 style="margin-left: 25%">What we do</h2>
     <p style="margin-left: 25%">
         Many women eventually drop out of STEM fields because of organisational barriers 
         to career progression, lack of career guidance and support, and family commitments. 
         The same is not true for men who work in STEM. Although many women successfully balance 
         their careers and family responsibilities, there are still institutional obstacles for 
         women in STEM. We want to break the gender gap, identify and raise the profile of women 
         in STEM by encouraging them to learn and grow by giving them role models and mentors who  
         share their knowledge and experiences in their respective fields.
